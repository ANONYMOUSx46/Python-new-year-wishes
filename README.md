## Two small Python programmes/scritps:

Just my small way of wishing a Happy New Year to my fellow 'coders'ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

1) The GUI based one, works with tkinter gui and a few other python dependensies. This one is, as i will admit funny and in some way ridiculous as I made it out of boredomðŸ˜‚.
   Before running the code make sure that you have the Python and the Python dependencies, pygame and pillow installed on your machine. If you don't run these two commands for the dependencies:
   <pre>
    python install pygame
    pyhton install pillow
   </pre>
    Also make sure that the mp3 is in the same directory as the python file. If the name does get changed rename it to 'celebration_music'.
  
  

3) The CLI based one is a basic pyhton script that is run from the terminal. The emojies will only show if your OS version or terminal supports it.
